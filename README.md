# 🏡 **Boston Housing Linear Regression** 📊

This project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict the **median value of homes (MEDV)** in the Boston area using the famous **Boston Housing dataset**. The goal is to demonstrate the process of **data preprocessing**, **feature scaling**, and **model evaluation** in a regression task. 

## 📍 **Project Overview**

In this project, we utilize the Boston Housing dataset to perform a regression task. By using **Linear Regression**, we attempt to predict the median value of homes based on multiple input features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rate. The dataset is preprocessed using **StandardScaler**, and the model is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**. 

## 🛠️ **Key Features**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Checking for missing values and standardizing features.
- **Model Training**: Training a **Linear Regression** model on the training data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **R² Score**.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the actual vs predicted home prices for evaluation.

## 📚 **Libraries Used**:
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: Numerical computing.
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization.
- `sklearn`: Machine learning tools, including regression models and evaluation metrics.

## 🔄 **Project Workflow**:

1. **Load Dataset**: Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Check for any missing values in the dataset.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Separate features and the target variable (MEDV).
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize features using **StandardScaler**.
5. **Model Training**: Train a **Linear Regression** model on the data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using **MSE**, **RMSE**, and **R² Score**.
7. **Visualization**: Create a scatter plot comparing the actual vs predicted prices.

## 🚀 **How to Run**:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Place the **BostonHousing.csv** file in the project directory.
4. Run the `boston_linear_regression.py` script:
   ```
   python boston_linear_regression.py
   ```

## 📈 **Results**:

Upon running the model, you will get an output with the model’s evaluation metrics and a plot showing how well the model predicted the home prices compared to the actual values.

**Sample Output:**
```
Model Evaluation:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 24.28
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 4.93
R² Score: 0.88
```

## 🔍 **Conclusion**:

This project serves as an introduction to **Linear Regression** using a well-known dataset. It also covers key machine learning concepts such as **data preprocessing**, **training a model**, **evaluating model performance**, and **visualizing the results**.
